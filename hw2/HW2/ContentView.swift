//1. go to Practice.swift to start!
//2. lets get started on our personal fun facts page. we'll be making use of the LazyVGrid to format each of our facts; its ok if you dont totally get how this works yet!


// 1. make a structure called Person, containing spots for your name, grade, the path to an image, age, and hometown.
struct Person {
    //TODO: fill here
    let name: String;
    let grade: String;
    let img: String;
    let age: Int;
    let hometown: String;
}

// this struct contains the information necessary for every fact
struct Fact: Identifiable {
    var id: UUID
    var description: String
    var image: String
}

// 2. take a look at the video I sent to see how your information should be organized, and try to recreate the top section here!
// tip: PersonView POPULATES the data from the instance of a Person and formats it within a VStack.

struct PersonView: View{
    var person: Person
    var body: some View{
        HStack {
            VStack (spacing: 10) {
                // TODO: fill in this VStack with info about yourself
                // hint: can you use attributes of a person instance? like abinaya.name
                Text("Hiiiiiiiiii")
                Text(person.name)
                Text(person.grade)
                Text("\(person.age)")
                Text(person.hometown)
            }.padding(.leading)

            Image(person.img).resizable().scaledToFit().cornerRadius(50).padding(10)
//            UNCOMMENT THE ABOVE AFTER IMPLEMENTING PERSON.STRUCT

        }.background(Color.orange).cornerRadius(50).padding(.leading)

//this contains the information for every fact. for example, you might want a description of the fact, an associated image to start off. nothing to do here!
